# TLS Support

Support for TLS is implemented with `rustls` and its `async` derivatives `async-rustls` and `tokio-rustls`. 

An example using a self-signed certificate can be found in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/minghuaw/toy-rpc/tree/main/examples/tokio_tls).

More detailed documentations are underway.
